  This gadget attempts to mess with copies of itself that fail to have distinct
  id namespaces through Domita. If it is properly isolated, then touchCount
  will become and remain 1; if not, it will be 0 or higher than 1 depending on
  which element it actually looks up.
-->

<div id="c">0</div>
<script>
  var touchCount;
  var e = document.getElementById("c");
  touchCount = parseInt(e.innerHTML) + 1;
  e.innerHTML = touchCount.toString();
</script>
