<h2>Check for Problems</h2>
<p>Running this will look for problems with your HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript and report them.  If the input is HTML, it will look for JS
and CSS in <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
elements, and inside attributes like <code>onclick=</code> and
<code>style=</code>.

<p>The rerendered output is displayed below any messages, and if you
specify a <a href="user_agent_help.html">user agent</a>, the
rerendered output will have optimizations performed.

<h2>Debiggify</h2>
Running this will perform optimizations on your code and output the
result.
If the input contains source files of different types, then the output
will be an HTML document that stitches the inputs together.

<h2>JSDoc</h2>
Running this will generate HTML documentation from your code and
prompt you to download a ZIP file containing the output.  Since
browsing a documentation tree requires serving lots of small files you
can't see the results in your browser.  We encourage you to download
and integrate JSDoc into your automated test runs.
