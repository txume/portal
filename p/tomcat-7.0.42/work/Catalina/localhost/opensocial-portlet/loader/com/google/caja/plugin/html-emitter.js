  // Below we define the attach, detach, and finish operations.
  // These obey the conventions that:
  //   (1) All detached nodes, along with their ex-parents are in detached,
  //       and they are ordered depth-first.
  //   (2) When a node is specified by an ID, after the operation is performed,
  //       it is in the tree.
  //   (3) Each node is attached to the same parent regardless of what the
  //       script does.  Even if a node is removed from the DOM by a script,
  //       any of its children that appear after the script, will be added.
  // As an example, consider this HTML which has the end-tags removed since
  // they don't correspond to actual nodes.
  //   <table>
  //     <script>
  //     <tr>
  //       <td>Foo<script>Bar
  //       <th>Baz
  //   <script>
  //   <p>The-End
  // There are two script elements, and we need to make sure that each only
  // sees the bits of the DOM that it is supposed to be aware of.
  //
  // To make sure that things work when javascript is off, we emit the whole
  // HTML tree, and then detach everything that shouldn't be present.
  // We represent the removed bits as pairs of (removedNode, parentItWasPartOf).
  // Including both makes us robust against changes scripts make to the DOM.
  // In this case, the detach operation results in the tree
  //   <table>
  // and the detached list
  //   [<tr><td>FooBar<th>Baz in <table>, <p>The-End in (base)]

  // After the first script executes, we reattach the bits needed by the second
  // script, which gives us the DOM
  //   <table><tr><td>Foo
  // and the detached list
  //   ['Bar' in <td>, <th>Baz in <tr>, <p>The-End in (base)]
  // Note that we did not simply remove items from the old detached list.  Since
  // the second script was deeper than the first, we had to add only a portion
  // of the <tr>'s content which required doing a separate mini-detach operation
  // and push its operation on to the front of the detached list.

  // After the second script executes, we reattach the bits needed by the third
  // script, which gives us the DOM
  //   <table><tr><td>FooBar<th>Baz
  // and the detached list
  //   [<p>The-End in (base)]

  // After the third script executes, we reattached the rest of the detached
  // nodes, and we're done.

  // To perform a detach or reattach operation, we impose a depth-first ordering
  // on HTML start tags, and text nodes:
  //   [0: <table>, 1: <tr>, 2: <td>, 3: 'Foo', 4: 'Bar', 5: <th>, 6: 'Baz',
  //    7: <p>, 8: 'The-End']
  // Then the detach operation simply removes the minimal number of nodes from
  // the DOM to make sure that only a prefix of those nodes are present.
  // In the case above, we are detaching everything after item 0.
  // Then the reattach operation advances the number.  In the example above, we
  // advance the index from 0 to 3, and then from 3 to 6.
  // The finish operation simply reattaches the rest, advancing the counter from
  // 6 to the end.

  // The minimal detached list from the node with DFS index I is the ordered
  // list such that a (node, parent) pair (N, P) is on the list if
  // dfs-index(N) > I and there is no pair (P, GP) on the list.

  // To calculate the minimal detached list given a node representing a point in
  // that ordering, we rely on the following observations:
  //    The minimal detached list after a node, is the concatenation of
  //    (1) that node's children in order
  //    (2) the next sibling of that node and its later siblings,
  //        the next sibling of that node's parent and its later siblings,
  //        the next sibling of that node's grandparent and its later siblings,
  //        etc., until base is reached.
